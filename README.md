## My process

- I started by adding HTML tags to organize the content, adding classes where I expected to use CSS. I used the information from the style guide to make custom properties and added one of my own for the corner radius.
- Once I finished the mobile design, I worked on the media query for desktop and then the hover states for the buttons.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Before starting the challenge, I had been centering content horizontally but I hadn't really worked with vertical centering. I also didn't realize the difference between justify-items and justify-content. Now I feel a lot more comfortable with those concepts.

### Continued development

I would like to learn more about media queries and how to make the transition between different devices smoother and to work on making my css as concise as possible.
